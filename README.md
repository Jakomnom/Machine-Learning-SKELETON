Machine Learning Algorithms Repository
This repository contains implementations of various machine learning algorithms and models in Python. Each algorithm is implemented in a separate Python file, and you can find detailed explanations and examples in the corresponding files.

Getting Started
To use these implementations, you'll need to have Python installed on your system. Clone this repository to your local machine using the following command:
```
git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo-name.git
```
Replace your-username and your-repo-name with your GitHub username and the name of the repository, respectively.

Usage
Each Python file contains the implementation of a specific machine learning algorithm. You can run these files individually to understand how each algorithm works and how to use them for different tasks.

For example, to run the k-Nearest Neighbors algorithm, you can execute the following command:

```
python KKN.py
```
Please make sure to have any required dependencies installed before running the scripts.

File Descriptions
Here's a brief description of each file in the repository:

k-Nearest Neighbors (KKN)

Files: KKN.py, KKN2.py
Description: The k-Nearest Neighbors algorithm is a simple yet effective classification and regression method. It assigns a label to a new data point based on the majority class of its k nearest neighbors in the feature space.
Decision Tree

Files: decision_tree.py, decision_tree v2.py
Description: Decision Trees are powerful algorithms used for both classification and regression tasks. They recursively split the dataset into subsets based on the most informative features, creating a tree-like structure to make predictions.
Gradient Boosting

Files: gradient_booster.py, gradient_booster2.py
Description: Gradient Boosting is an ensemble learning technique that builds multiple weak learners (usually decision trees) sequentially. Each new tree corrects the errors of the previous ones, leading to better overall predictions.
Hierarchical Clustering

Files: hierarchical.py, hierarchical2.py
Description: Hierarchical Clustering is a method for grouping similar data points into clusters by iteratively merging or splitting clusters based on their similarity.
k-means Clustering

Files: kmeans.py, kmeans2.py
Description: k-means is an unsupervised learning algorithm used for clustering data into k distinct groups. The algorithm aims to minimize the variance within each cluster.
Linear Regression with Gradient Descent Optimization

File: linear_regression_gradient_descent_optimize.py
Description: Linear Regression is a simple and widely used algorithm for predicting numeric values based on linear relationships between features and the target variable. The implementation uses gradient descent optimization to find the best-fit line.
Logistic Regression Classifier

File: logistic_regression_classifier.py
Description: Logistic Regression is a binary classification algorithm that models the probability of a sample belonging to a particular class. It is widely used in various applications.
Naive Bayes

Files: naive_bayes.py, naive_bayes2.py
Description: Naive Bayes is a probabilistic algorithm based on Bayes' theorem. It is commonly used for classification tasks and is particularly suited for text classification.
Neural Networks

Files: neural_network.py, neural_network2.py
Description: Neural Networks are deep learning models inspired by the human brain's structure. They are capable of learning complex patterns and have been successful in various applications, including image and speech recognition.
Non-negative Matrix Factorization (NMF)

Files: nmf.py, nmf2.py
Description: NMF is a matrix factorization technique that decomposes non-negative data into the product of non-negative matrices. It is often used for dimensionality reduction and feature extraction.
Random Forest

Files: random_forest.py, random_forest2.py
Description: Random Forest is an ensemble learning method that constructs multiple decision trees during training and outputs the mode of the classes (classification) or the mean prediction (regression) of the individual trees.
Support Vector Machines (SVM)

Files: svm.py, svm2.py
Description: SVM is a powerful supervised learning algorithm used for classification and regression tasks. It finds the hyperplane that best separates classes or approximates a regression function with the largest margin.
